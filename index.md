title: Multiscale - analysis and learning of multi* remote sensing data
description: Special session of [ICPRAI'22](https://icprai2022.sciencesconf.org/) - 1 June 2022

## About

This session deals with the learning and analysis of multi-variate and/or multi-temporal
and/or multi-resolution and/or multi-source remote sensing images (hereafter denoted as multi*
remote sensing data).

The huge amount of data currently produced by modern remote sensing missions (aerial and
satellite) has raised up new challenges for the remote sensing communities. These sensors are now
able to offer (very) high spatial resolution images with revisit time frequencies never achieved before,
considering different kind of signals, e.g., multi(hyper)-spectral optical, radar, LiDAR and digital surface
models. In this context, pattern recognition and artificial intelligence (PRAI) techniques play a crucial
role to deal with such an impressive amount of multi-source, multi-resolution and multi-temporal data.
Learning techniques as unsupervised and supervised approaches, neural networks, deep learning,
domain adaptation, time series analysis, etc. are used to tackle different challenging remote sensing
oriented tasks such as semantic segmentation, classification, detection and tracking of objects for earth
observation and environmental monitoring.

This special session will be an opportunity to give an overview of recent progress of PRAI
research studies, in which new methodological, computational and practical achievements dedicated
to multivariate remote sensing data will be presented. It also will be a renewed opportunity to gather
PRAI and domain-experts researchers, in order to exchange, debate and draw short and long term
research objectives around the exploitation, analysis and processing of multimodal remote sensing
data coming from heterogeneous sensors. The aim is to stimulate concrete discussions to pave the way
to new frameworks especially tailored in the domain.

## Venue
Multiscale is a special session part of [ICPRAI'22](https://icprai2022.sciencesconf.org/), which is the 3rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence. It is held in Paris from the 1st to the 3rd of June and follows the successful 2018 edition located in Montréal, Canada and the 2020 (virtual) edition held in Zhongshan City, China.

## Call for Papers

We welcome contributions of both technical and perspective papers from a wide range of topics, including but not limited to the following topics of interest: 
- Artificial intelligence applied to multi* remote sensing data
- Recognition of patterns, objects and targets from multi* remote sensing data
- 2D/3D remote sensing data analysis and processing
- Multi* remote sensing image classification, retrieval and semantic segmentation
- Machine learning, deep learning approaches to deal with multi* remote sensing data
- Analysis of multi-resolution remote sensing images
- Fusion of multi-source remote sensing data
- Multi-temporal remote sensing data analysis and classification
- Transfer Learning and domain adaptation for multi* remote sensing data
- Feature extraction and feature selection for multi* remote sensing data
