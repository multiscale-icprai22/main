## Analysis and learning of multi* remote sensing data

This session deals with the learning and analysis of multi-variate and/or multi-temporal
and/or multi-resolution and/or multi-source remote sensing images (hereafter denoted as multi*
remote sensing data).

The huge amount of data currently produced by modern remote sensing missions (aerial and
satellite) has raised up new challenges for the remote sensing communities. These sensors are now
able to offer (very) high spatial resolution images with revisit time frequencies never achieved before,
considering different kind of signals, e.g., multi(hyper)-spectral optical, radar, LiDAR and digital surface
models. In this context, pattern recognition and artificial intelligence (PRAI) techniques play a crucial
role to deal with such an impressive amount of multi-source, multi-resolution and multi-temporal data.
Learning techniques as unsupervised and supervised approaches, neural networks, deep learning,
domain adaptation, time series analysis, etc. are used to tackle different challenging remote sensing
oriented tasks such as semantic segmentation, classification, detection and tracking of objects for earth
observation and environmental monitoring.

This special session will be an opportunity to give an overview of recent progress of PRAI
research studies, in which new methodological, computational and practical achievements dedicated
to multivariate remote sensing data will be presented. It also will be a renewed opportunity to gather
PRAI and domain-experts researchers, in order to exchange, debate and draw short and long term
research objectives around the exploitation, analysis and processing of multimodal remote sensing
data coming from heterogeneous sensors. The aim is to stimulate concrete discussions to pave the way
to new frameworks especially tailored in the domain.

## Paper submission guidelines

The contributed papers will be submitted in the same format as regular papers of the ICPRAI'22 conference (see Author guidelines).  Accepted papers will be presented at the conference and will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science.
Articles should be prepared according to the LNCS author guidelines and templates and they should be at most twelve pages long. All papers must be submitted in electronic format as PDF files before the submission deadline.
Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least 3 reviewers, and assessed based on their novelty, clarity significance, and relevance regarding the special session topics. Submissions that are already accepted or under review for another venue are not accepted.
